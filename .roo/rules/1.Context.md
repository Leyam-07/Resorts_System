Scope and Limitation

The project entails the creation and implementation of an Integrated Digital Management System specifically for five small private pool resorts in Brgy. Pansol, Calamba City, Laguna: Calidas de Maria, Villa Elisha, Classico, Season's Villa, and Nathan's Private Pool. The system is created to be accessible for resort owners, staff, and guests, with options for access through web and mobile platforms to enable flexible cross-device usage.
Resort owners have complete administrative authority for the system, such as access to financial statements, booking summaries, personnel management, and the capability to change resort policy and settings. staff are allowed to view information on
day-to-day operational activities like handling bookings, confirming customers' details, scheduling facilities, and sending reminders to visitors. Customers can make online bookings independently, handle their own personal information, monitor payment, get up-to-date information in real-time, and provide feedback using an easy-to-use interface. It includes:
Customer information input and management module. The system securely collects and manages personal details like names and contact info for booking and customer service purposes. Data is stored in compliance with privacy laws, protected against unauthorized access, and never shared without consent. Guests may request access to or deletion of their data.
Facility usage scheduling and availability display. A visual scheduling system displays real-time facility availability, preventing double bookings and aiding staff in managing reservations. Guests can select preferred time slots during booking, with changes allowed at least 24 hours in advance. The resort may adjust bookings for emergencies or maintenance with notice.
Feedback and review submission module. Guests can submit reviews within the system, providing valuable insights for service improvement. Feedback is moderated to ensure respectful and relevant content, and anonymous reviews may be used for internal or promotional purposes. Inappropriate or false reviews are subject to removal.
Online booking and reservation feature. Customers can check real-time availability and make confirmed reservations directly through the official website or app. Bookings are only confirmed upon receipt of the required deposit or full payment, and guests must agree to the terms before finalization. Cancellations and changes follow the resort’s policy, and a booking reference is required at check-in.
Payment tracking and processing function. Digital payments are handled through secure gateways, simulating real-world transactions while logging details for internal tracking. Receipts are issued via email or app notifications, and refunds are
processed per the resort’s policy. All transactions are encrypted to ensure accuracy and transparency.
Real-time notifications to guests. Automated reminders and updates are sent via email to keep guests informed and reduce no-shows. These include check-in details, schedules, and guidelines. While promotional alerts are optional, service-related notifications are required.
Staff and admin dashboard access. Authorized staff have role-based access to operational tools and data for efficient management. Actions are logged for accountability, and strict security protocols, including strong passwords and confidentiality requirements, are enforced to protect guest information.
The system depends on stable internet connectivity for real-time booking, notifications, and updates, which may affect usability in areas with poor network access. Payment processing is simulated through secure gateways, but actual transaction reliability depends on third-party providers outside the developers’ control. While accessible via web and mobile platforms, device compatibility and performance may vary. Data privacy and security measures comply with local laws but do not guarantee full international regulatory compliance or advanced cybersecurity certification. The feedback module includes basic moderation but cannot fully prevent inappropriate content without manual oversight. Additionally, the system does not incorporate advanced features like AI analytics and relies on each resort’s policies for booking, cancellations, and refunds, limiting standardization across resorts.

System Development

The Integrated Digital Management System (IDMS) for Calidas de Maria, Villa Elisha, Classico, Season's Villa, and Nathan's Private Pool was developed using the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model to provide a systematic and efficient approach to automating and managing resort operations. The IPO model enabled the transformation of real-world challenges, such as manual bookings, payment tracking, facility scheduling, and customer coordination, into a functional digital solution aimed at enhancing operational accuracy, minimizing errors, and improving the user experience. The system was designed to standardize processes across multiple resort properties and provide role-based access to users, including staff, admins, and customers.

The development process was executed in five key phases:

1. Requirement Analysis: Collected system requirements from interviews and surveys of Calidas de Maria, Villa Elisha, Classico, Season's Villa, and Nathan's Private Pool resort owners, caretakers, and customers to understand the operational problems.
2. System Design: Developed flowcharts and UML diagrams to define the structure and functionality of modules like booking, payments, and scheduling.
3. Development Phase: Coded and implemented key features, including real-time reservations, customer management, payment tracking, and notifications.
4. Testing & Evaluation: Performed usability testing with users and resort staff to verify usability and functionality; iterated the system based on feedback.
5. Deployment & Maintenance: Installed the system at a partner resort, offered staff training, and provided technical support and maintenance on an ongoing basis.
   Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

This phase involved gathering data through interviews and direct observations conducted across the five resorts. The primary goal was to identify recurring issues in the current manual setup, such as:
● Double bookings and overlapping reservations
● Unclear payment tracking and lack of real-time status
● Absence of structured customer record management
● Disorganized facility schedules and staff roles
● Limited guest engagement features and communication tools

Based on these findings, the researchers established the functional and non- functional requirements. Functional requirements included modules for online booking, customer info management, real-time facility scheduling, and notification systems. Non- functional requirements emphasized system reliability, usability, and security.
Phase 2: System Design

The system design phase translated the requirements into a detailed technical blueprint. Key design components included:
Database Architecture: Modeled in MySQL to handle records on bookings, users, payments, facility schedules, and staff roles.
User Interface (UI): Implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and mobile-compatible user interface.
UML Diagrams:

Use Case Diagrams – Created for modules like Reservations, Customer Info Management, Facility Scheduling, Payments, and Notifications.
Activity Diagrams – Designed to model dynamic workflows, including the end-to-end booking process, payment procedures, and customer notification flows.
Class Diagram – Established relationships between major objects such as Users, Bookings, Facilities, Payments, and Feedback.
Security Features: Focused on the addition of role-based access, secure login/logout processes, and input data validation.
Phase 3: Development Phase

The system was developed using the following technologies:

PHP – For handling server-side logic and back-end processing

It shows how a customer interacts with the system to perform actions such as Browse availability, making a booking, uploading payment proof, and canceling a booking. The diagram also highlights supporting processes, like validating guest capacity and creating booking records when a booking is made, and applying a late- cancellation penalty if a booking is canceled late. This visual representation helps understand the primary user interactions and the system's core features.

Online Booking and Reservation's Activity Diagrams

Activity Diagram for Browse Availability

This activity diagram illustrates the process flow for a "Customer" checking availability within the "System." The process begins with the customer initiating a "View Calendar" action, which prompts the system to "Display Available Dates." The customer then proceeds to "Select Desired Date." Upon selection, the system attempts to "Retrieve Time Slot" for that date. A decision point is reached to check if "Time Available?" If no time is available, the system shows "No Available Time in this Date," and the process loops back to "View Calendar" for the customer to try again. If time is available, the system will "Display Time Available," and the process concludes. This diagram clearly maps out the steps and decision points in checking and confirming availability

Activity Diagram for Make Booking

This activity diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of a "Customer" making a booking with the "System." The process begins with the customer entering a desired "Date and Time Slot." The system then proceeds to "Verify Availability." A decision point checks if the "Date and Time Available?" If not, the system displays "Not Available," and the customer is prompted to re-enter a date and time. If available, the system "Queries Database for Slot Status." Following this, the customer enters the "No. of Guest." The system then "Create Booking Record" and "Auto-Send Confirmation Notice" to the customer. Finally, the system "Offer Payment Options" to the customer, concluding the booking process. This diagram clearly outlines the user and system interactions for completing a reservation

Activity Diagram for Payment Verification

Class Diagrams

User and Account Management - The User and Account Management diagram establishes the foundational user architecture by applying the object-oriented principle of inheritance. It introduces an abstract User class to encapsulate common attributes and behaviors, from which three specialized roles are derived: Admin, Staff, and Customer. This "Is-A" relationship is a clear hierarchical model where each specialized class inherits the core User functionality while also possessing its own unique properties and methods. By leveraging abstraction and inheritance, this design centralizes common logic, promotes code reuse, and creates a flexible structure for managing distinct user permissions and capabilities within the system.

Class Diagram for Customer Perspective - This diagram illustrates the complete customer journey through a series of well- defined class relationships. The structure is defined by key associations, such as the one-to-many relationship linking a Customer to their multiple Bookings. A composition relationship is used to show that the Resort entity is composed of one or more Facilities, which cannot exist independently. Each Booking is further associated with Payment records and an optional Feedback entry, clearly mapping the data flow from the end- user's point of view. This customer-centric view uses these clear relationships to model all primary touchpoints, from initial browsing and reservation to post-visit engagement.

Class Diagram for Admin Perspective - The Admin Perspective diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the administrator's extensive management capabilities, visualized through a series of direct associations. This view is dominated by one-to-many relationships that position the Admin as a central actor with connections to all key system components, such as Bookings, Payments, and Staff accounts. These associations grant the Admin the authority to perform system-wide configurations and oversee daily operations. By visualizing these direct control pathways, which are logically grouped into areas like Configuration and Management, the diagram effectively demonstrates the administrator's complete authority and the system's centralized control structure.

Class Diagram for Staff Perspective - This diagram is tailored to the operational needs of resort staff by focusing on a crucial association between the Task and Booking classes. This relationship ensures that every operational task, such as cleaning or preparation, is explicitly linked to a specific guest reservation, providing clear context and purpose. The model shows that a Staff member has a one-to-many association with their assigned Tasks, allowing them to view a complete list of their responsibilities. This focused design embodies the principle of least privilege by providing staff with only the necessary information to perform their duties efficiently, without access to sensitive financial or administrative data.

Class Diagram for Core System Model - The Core System Model diagram illustrates the structural backbone of the application by defining the relationships between key business entities. It establishes the Booking object as a central nexus, linked to a Customer via a one-to-many association. A strong aggregation or composition relationship connects the Booking to the Facilities it reserves, signifying that these facilities are allocated for the duration of the booking. Further associations link each Booking to its corresponding Payment records and a single Invoice. A dependency relationship is also shown, where a Booking can trigger the creation of Notification objects, representing a more transient connection. By defining these precise relationships and their multiplicities, this model establishes the fundamental business rules and ensures the data integrity of the entire system.
