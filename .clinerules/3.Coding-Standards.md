# 3. Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards and conventions for the project. Adhering to these guidelines is mandatory to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## 1. General Principles

- **Language:** All code, comments, and documentation must be written in English.
- **Clarity:** Write clear, self-documenting code. Avoid overly clever or complex solutions where a simpler one would suffice.
- **Consistency:** The style and conventions described here should be applied uniformly across the entire codebase.

## 2. PHP Standards

The project follows the **PSR-12 (Extended Coding Style)** standard. Key highlights include:

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `User`, `BookingManager`).
  - Methods: `camelCase` (e.g., `createBooking`, `getUserDetails`).
  - Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `$userName`, `$bookingId`).
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `define('MAX_GUESTS', 10);`).
- **File Naming:** Files containing a single class should be named `ClassName.php`.
- **Braces:** Opening braces for classes and methods go on the next line. Opening braces for control structures go on the same line.
- **Security:**
  - Always use **prepared statements** (`PDO` or `MySQLi`) for database queries to prevent SQL injection.
  - Sanitize all user input before processing it (`htmlspecialchars`, `filter_input`).
  - Validate data on the server-side, even if it's already validated on the client-side.

## 3. JavaScript Standards

- **Framework:** Use vanilla JavaScript where possible. If a framework is needed, it must be approved.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Variables and Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `let bookingData`, `function validateForm()`).
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `class FormValidator`).
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `const API_ENDPOINT = '/api';`).
- **Variables:** Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned and `const` for variables that will not. Avoid `var`.
- **Comments:** Use JSDoc for documenting functions, especially for complex logic.

## 4. MySQL Standards

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Tables: `PascalCase` and plural (e.g., `Users`, `Bookings`).
  - Columns: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserID`, `FirstName`).
  - Foreign Keys: `[ReferencedTableName]ID` (e.g., `CustomerID` in the `Bookings` table).
- **Keywords:** All SQL keywords should be in `UPPERCASE` (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`).
- **Data Integrity:** Use the most appropriate data types (`INT`, `VARCHAR`, `TIMESTAMP`, `ENUM`) and define `NOT NULL` constraints where applicable.

## 5. HTML & CSS (Bootstrap) Standards

- **Structure:** Write semantic HTML5. Use tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` correctly.
- **Indentation:** Use two spaces for indentation.
- **Bootstrap:**
  - Utilize the Bootstrap grid system (`row`, `col-`) for all layouts.
  - Use Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, alignment, and styling wherever possible to minimize custom CSS.
  - Do not override core Bootstrap styles directly. If customization is needed, create a separate `custom.css` file and load it after the Bootstrap CSS.
