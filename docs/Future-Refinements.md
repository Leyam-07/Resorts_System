- [x] **Login Failures:**
  - [x] Attempt login with a valid username and incorrect password.
  - [x] Attempt login with a non-existent username.
  - (Result for both should be a generic "Invalid credentials" error).

### ðŸ”’ Authorization & Access Control (Completed)

- [x] **Cross-Role Access Denial:**
  - [x] Logged-in Customer cannot access Admin URLs (e.g., `/admin/users`).
  - [x] Logged-in Staff cannot access Admin URLs.
- [x] **Unauthenticated Access:**
  - [x] Logged-out user attempting to access a protected page is redirected to login.
- [x] **Session Security:**
  - [x] After logout, browser 'back' button does not reveal authenticated content.

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

This section contains suggestions for more in-depth testing to improve robustness and user experience.

### 1. Password Management Lifecycle

- [ ] **Forgot Password Flow:**
  - [ ] Verify a "Forgot Password" link exists on the login page.
  - [ ] Verify a user can request a password reset.
  - [ ] Verify the system sends a password reset email to the registered address.
  - [ ] Verify the password reset link works correctly.
  - [ ] Verify the reset link can only be used once and/or expires.
  - [ ] Verify the user can successfully set a new password.
- [ ] **Password Change Security:**
  - [ ] Verify the "Change Password" form in the user profile requires the user to enter their _current_ password.

### 2. Deeper Authorization Tests

- [ ] **Staff "View-Only" Enforcement:**
  - [ ] Log in as Staff and confirm that UI elements for editing/deleting data are not visible (e.g., "Save" or "Delete" buttons on a user profile).
  - [ ] Attempt to bypass the UI by sending a direct `POST` request to an endpoint that modifies data. The server should return a `403 Forbidden` error.
- [ ] **Admin User Creation:**
  - [ ] Verify an Admin can create a new user of any role (Customer, Staff, Admin) via the admin panel.

### 3. Account Deletion Workflow

- [ ] **Deletion Pending State:**
  - [ ] After a Customer requests deletion, log in as an Admin to check for a pending approval queue or notification.
  - [ ] Determine the account status of a user who has requested deletion but has not been approved yet. Can they still log in?

### 4. Session Management Edge Cases

- [ ] **Session Timeout:**
  - [ ] Verify that a user's session automatically expires and requires re-login after a defined period of inactivity.
- [ ] **Concurrent Logins:**
  - [ ] Test the system's behavior when a single user account logs in from multiple devices/browsers simultaneously. (Define expected behavior: allow, or invalidate older session).

## Phase 1: Booking Engine (Version 1.3.0)

This section covers testing for the booking engine and related features.

### âœ… Core Test Plan (Completed)

- [x] **Booking Creation (Happy Path):**
  - [x] Logged-in Customer can access the booking form.
  - [x] Form successfully loads available facilities.
  - [x] Submitting valid data creates a booking record in the database.
  - [x] User is redirected to a styled success page.
- [x] **Validation & Error Handling:**
  - [x] Submitting an empty form displays validation errors.
  - [x] Form fields are repopulated with previous input on validation failure.
  - [x] Attempting to book a past date is rejected.
  - [x] Attempting to book an already reserved slot is rejected with an error message.
- [x] **Security & Access Control:**
  - [x] Logged-out users are redirected to login when trying to access the booking page.
  - [x] Staff users are redirected and cannot access the booking creation page.
  - [x] A user can only cancel their own bookings.
- [x] **Booking Cancellation:**
  - [x] A "My Bookings" page exists for customers to see their reservations.
  - [x] A "Cancel" button is present for upcoming bookings.
  - [x] Clicking "Cancel" successfully deletes the booking and updates the view.

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

#### 1. Notification System (Phase 3 Alignment)

- [ ] **Event-Driven Notifications:**
  - [ ] Create a `notifications` table in the database to log notification events.
  - [ ] The `BookingController` should create a new record in `notifications` when a booking is successfully **created**.
  - [ ] The `BookingController` should create a new record in `notifications` when a booking is successfully **canceled**.
- [ ] **Automated Communication:**
  - [ ] Implement a mechanism (e.g., a cron job or an email service integration) to process the `notifications` table and send emails/SMS to users.
  - [ ] Develop email templates for booking confirmation, cancellation, and reminders.
  - [ ] Add logic to send automated reminders (e.g., 24 hours before the booking).

#### 2. Admin & Facility Management

- [ ] **Admin Booking Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Create a centralized view for Admins to see all bookings across all users.
  - [ ] Admins should be able to filter bookings by date, user, or facility.
  - [ ] Admins should have the ability to **create, edit, or cancel** any booking on behalf of a customer.
- [ ] **Blackout Dates:**
  - [ ] Implement a feature for Admins to block specific dates or date ranges for maintenance, holidays, or private events.
  - [ ] The booking form should not allow users to select blackout dates.

#### 3. UX & Financial Enhancements

- [ ] **Display Pricing on Booking Form:**
  - [ ] When a user selects a facility and date, dynamically display the price for that booking.
  - [ ] Clearly indicate the required downpayment amount, if applicable.
- [ ] **Improved Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Provide more specific error messages for booking conflicts (e.g., "Sorry, that slot was just taken. Please select another.").
