### ðŸŽ¯ Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

#### 1. Booking History Enhancements

- [ ] **Pagination:**
  - [ ] Implement pagination on the "My Bookings" page for customers to handle long booking histories.
  - [ ] Implement pagination on the admin's "View User Bookings" page.
- [ ] **Filtering and Sorting:**
  - [ ] Add controls for both customers and admins to filter booking history by a date range.
  - [ ] Add controls to sort the history (e.g., newest first, oldest first).
- [ ] **Data Export:**
  - [ ] Add a feature for customers to export their own booking history (e.g., to CSV or PDF).
  - [ ] Add a feature for admins to export a specific user's booking history.

#### 2. Admin Notes Improvements

- [ ] **Notes Audit Trail:**
  - [ ] Create a `NoteHistory` table to log changes to the `Notes` field.
  - [ ] Record which admin made the change and when it occurred.
  - [ ] Provide a way for admins to view the history of changes to a user's notes.
- [ ] **Search and Filtering:**
  - [ ] On the admin's user list, add a search filter to find users based on keywords within their notes.

#### 3. Deeper Authorization Tests

- [ ] **Staff "View-Only" Enforcement:**
  - [ ] Log in as Staff and confirm that UI elements for viewing user bookings are not visible.
  - [ ] Attempt to bypass the UI by sending a direct `GET` request to an endpoint that views user bookings (e.g., `view_user_bookings.php?user_id=X`). The server should return a `403 Forbidden` error.
- [ ] **Admin Self-Management Safeguards:**
  - [ ] Verify an Admin cannot change their own role when editing their own profile.

## Phase 1: Admin Dashboard (Version 1.5.1)

This section covers testing for the admin dashboard.

### âœ… Core Test Plan (Completed)

- [x] **Access Control:** Verified that only authorized users (Admins) can access the dashboard.
- [x] **Data Verification:** Ensured the dashboard displays the correct data for the current day.
- [x] **UI & Navigation:** Confirmed the user interface is correct and navigation links work as expected.
- [x] **Security Patch:** Blocked direct file access to the dashboard view for non-admin and unauthenticated users.

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

#### 1. Architectural Security Hardening

- [ ] **Implement a Front Controller:**
  - [ ] Configure the web server (e.g., via `.htaccess`) to route all requests through a single entry point (`public/index.php`).
  - [ ] Move all authentication and authorization checks from individual View files into the `AdminController`. This centralizes security logic and prevents direct URL access to sensitive views, adhering more strictly to the MVC pattern.

  - [ ] Add functionality for Admins to set up recurring blocked times (e.g., weekly maintenance, daily closures).
  - [ ] Provide options for daily, weekly, or custom recurrence patterns.
- [ ] **Public-Facing Availability View:**
  - [ ] Create a read-only, user-friendly calendar view for Customers to check a facility's general availability before initiating the booking process.
  - [ ] This view should clearly indicate available and unavailable (booked/blocked) slots without revealing sensitive details.
- [ ] **Display Block Reason:**

  - [ ] Implement a UI for admins to log refunds against a specific payment, especially for canceled bookings.

#### 4. Enhanced Invoice Generation

- [ ] **Printable Invoices:**
  - [ ] Implement a feature to generate a detailed, printable HTML invoice for any booking, including a breakdown of payments.

- [x] **UI/UX Testing:** Checked the dashboard's responsiveness and visual consistency for the new reporting components on multiple screen sizes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

#### 1. Financial Reporting Enhancements

## ðŸŽ¯ General Future Suggestions & Refinements Checklist

This section contains suggestions for more in-depth testing to improve robustness and user experience across the application.

### 1. Password Management Lifecycle

- [ ] **Forgot Password Flow:**
  - [ ] Verify a "Forgot Password" link exists on the login page.
  - [ ] Verify a user can request a password reset.
  - [ ] Verify the system sends a password reset email to the registered address.
  - [ ] Verify the password reset link works correctly.
  - [ ] Verify the reset link can only be used once and/or expires.
  - [ ] Verify the user can successfully set a new password.
- [ ] **Password Change Security:**
  - [ ] Verify the "Change Password" form in the user profile requires the user to enter their _current_ password.

### 2. Account Deletion Workflow

- [ ] **Deletion Pending State:**
  - [ ] After a Customer requests deletion, log in as an Admin to check for a pending approval queue or notification.
  - [ ] Determine the account status of a user who has requested deletion but has not been approved yet. Can they still log in?

### 3. Session Management Edge Cases

- [ ] **Session Timeout:**
  - [ ] Verify that a user's session automatically expires and requires re-login after a defined period of inactivity.
- [ ] **Concurrent Logins:**
  - [ ] Test the system's behavior when a single user account logs in from multiple devices/browsers simultaneously. (Define expected behavior: allow, or invalidate older session).

### 4. General Admin & Facility Management

- [ ] **Admin Booking Dashboard:**
  - [ ] Create a centralized view for Admins to see all bookings across all users.
  - [ ] Admins should be able to filter bookings by date, user, or facility.
  - [ ] Admins should have the ability to **create, edit, or cancel** any booking on behalf of a customer.
- [ ] **Blackout Dates:**
  - [ ] Implement a feature for Admins to block specific dates or date ranges for maintenance, holidays, or private events.
  - [ ] The booking form should not allow users to select blackout dates.

### 5. UX & Financial Enhancements

- [ ] **Display Pricing on Booking Form:**
  - [ ] When a user selects a facility and date, dynamically display the price for that booking.
  - [ ] Clearly indicate the required downpayment amount, if applicable.
- [ ] **Improved Error Handling:**
  - [ ] Provide more specific error messages for booking conflicts (e.g., "Sorry, that slot was just taken. Please select another.").

### 6. Notification System (Phase 3 Alignment)

- [ ] **Event-Driven Notifications:**
  - [ ] Create a `notifications` table in the database to log notification events.
  - [ ] The `BookingController` should create a new record in `notifications` when a booking is successfully **created**.
  - [ ] The `BookingController` should create a new record in `notifications` when a booking is successfully **canceled**.
- [ ] **Automated Communication:**
  - [ ] Implement a mechanism (e.g., a cron job or an email service integration) to process the `notifications` table and send emails/SMS to users.
  - [ ] Develop email templates for booking confirmation, cancellation, and reminders.
  - [ ] Add logic to send automated reminders (e.g., 24 hours before the booking).
